# Project Context
This freight management system connects companies with freight agents for shipping services. Companies create orders with cargo details while freight agents submit quotes. Features include order tracking, quote management, and communication tools. Freight agents(forwarders) and exporters have different views of pages when logged in, this is handled by using a routing based on company type for certain views such as /dashboard redirects to internal company type-specific route /forwarders/dashboard or /exporter/dashboard however we may have common pages or components such as /profile.

**Code Guidelines**
- Use modern JavaScript (ES6+), functional components, named exports
- Structure: component → subcomponents → helpers → static content
- Naming: descriptive with verbs (isLoading, hasError), dash-case for directories
- UI: Shadcn UI + Tailwind CSS, mobile-first, toast notifications(sonner) and loading states(/components/ui/loading-spinner.js)
- Data: Use Supabase for database and authentication. Centralize access in data-access layer
- Optimize Web Vitals (LCP, CLS, FID).
- Prefer React Server Components, Limit `'use client'`:
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.
- Performance: Suspense boundaries, dynamic imports, error/loading states
- Always implement responsive design and proper error handling

**General Preferences**
- Follow the users requirements carefully and precisely.
- Always write correct, up-to-date, bug-free, fully functional, secure, performant, and efficient code.
- Focus on readability over performance when appropriate.
- Fully implement all requested functionality.
- If you think there might not be a correct answer, say so. If you do not know the answer, admit it instead of guessing.
